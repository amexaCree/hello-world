A hello world program

Hi all!
Amy here. I want to be a software developer someday though I am actually in the electronics engineering sector at the moment. And this stuff sort of boggles my mind. I know I know. But I do love computers and programming hardware. One of my dreams was to run a masters program at ETH Zurich under Raffaello D'Andrea or work at Google or Amazon Robotics. However to realize either of these dreams I need to be more competent in the IT and Electronics Hardware areas, right? Well, before I bore you with too much info I'll stop right here.

Bye!
